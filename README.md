The task was to create a small application that was supposed to remind the functioning of the chatbot ELIZA. The requirement was that the dialogue system should speak the native language. (Polish language)
As a result of having fun with the task, I expanded the system and I think that a really cool prototype came out of it. The task taught me how many elements need to be considered in order for the chatbot's answers to convert well.
